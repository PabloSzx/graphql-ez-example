## Hackernews in Typescript

This project is inspired by [graphql-js](https://github.com/howtographql/graphql-js) by Robin MacPherson. Here, we will be building the same hackernews application in Typescript instead of Javascript and with the latest stack:

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): Typed JavaScript at Any Scale.
- [GraphQL EZ](https://www.graphql-ez.com/): Build GraphQL servers with ease by leveraging plugins based on [Envelop](https://github.com/dotansimha/envelop)
- [Fastify](https://github.com/fastify/fastify/) An efficient server for Node.js
- [GraphQL Helix](https://github.com/contrawork/graphql-helix/): A highly evolved GraphQL HTTP Server with zero dependencies except for graphql-js itself
- [graphql-js](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js) The JavaScript reference implementation for GraphQL
- [Envelop](https://github.com/dotansimha/envelop) Envelop is a lightweight JavaScript library for wrapping GraphQL execution layer and flow, allowing developers to develop, share and collaborate on GraphQL-related plugins, while filling the missing pieces in GraphQL implementations
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/): Replaces traditional ORMs. Use Prisma Client to access your database inside of
  GraphQL resolvers.
- [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql): A "GraphQL IDE" that allows you to interactively
  explore the functionality of a GraphQL API by sending queries and mutations to it. It's somewhat similar to
  [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) which offers comparable functionality for REST APIs.
